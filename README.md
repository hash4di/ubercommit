# ubercommit

Overcommit extensions for more focused development.

## Setup for project

Simply run:

```
sh install.sh ~/projects/my_fancy_project/
```

It syncs all hooks to project directory and ignores locally ones that
are not tracked in project.

Then just `inspire` whatever you want from `.overcommit.yml.example.ubercommit`
to your `.overcommit.yml` file.
